# Chats with DancinngCats

## Hi KK!

This is a little repo where we can practice Git and Github workflow together. 

To "git" started (lol) follow these instructions!

* Clone this repo to your machine with the command `git clone git@github.com:Abdeboskey/chatswithdancingcats.git`

* `cd` into the directory, and open it in your text editor with the command `atom .`

* In atom, open the file `README.md` and add some text with a level 3 heading, and write me a little message! Use markdown to make at least one bold word, and one italic word, and a bulleted (unordered) list of 3 things that you like about programming so far. [If you need a reminder of how to do these things, check this cheatsheet out](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) 

* When you have done that, `add` and `commit` your changes with a nice commit message of your choosing, and then push your changes back to github with the command `git push origin main` 

* Once your branch has been pushed, go to github and look at this repo in your browser. Your changes should appear in the README!

Good job! Let me know when you have pushed your changes, and then I'll send you the next assignment! 
(we'll practice making and merging a branch next!)
